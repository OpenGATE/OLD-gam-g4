This repository contains C++ source code that maps some (very few!)  Geant4 classes into one single Python module.

It also contains additional C++ classes that extends Geant4 functionalities (also mapped to Python).

At the end of the compilation process a single Python module is available, named `gam_g4` and is ready to use from the Python side.

See readthedocs FIXME.
